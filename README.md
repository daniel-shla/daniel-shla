## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Daniel, a computer science student at the University of Oslo, currently completing my bachelorâ€™s degree and planning to continue with a masterâ€™s.

Throughout my studies, Iâ€™ve focused on fullstack development, exploring frontend projects, low-level C programming, functional programming, and system-level coding challenges.

During my 2025 summer internship, I had the opportunity to deepen my fullstack development skills. A showcase repository can be found below.
